# Portfolio App

A ReactJS web app for my personal website. 

## What's it built with?

I have built this app with ReactJS, React-Bootstrap, Bootstrap 4 & Sass.

## What's the point of this project?

I wanted a way to practice some of the skills & techniques I've been learning & enhancing in ReactJS & React-Redux. I felt a good starting point would be to build my portfolio website as a React app. The app pulls data from a Firebase Real-Time database in to a Redux store & although not really necessary, it was a great way to practice my skills with React-Redux. I initially started building the app using React class components. But part the way through, I refactored the entire app to use functional components and React Hooks. The earlier version can be found in my other repos. 

## How to spin this app up

First clone the repo.

From the terminal `yarn run dev-server`

## To build the app

from the terminal `yarn run build:prod`

## To deploy the app to Firebase

from the terminal `firebase deploy`
